/**
 * The mapping between what a scan produces and what Prisma will accept (#747).
 *
 * `src/lib/scanner/scanEngine.ts` cannot be unit tested — it constructs an
 * Octokit app, talks to the LLM and writes through the shared Prisma client — so
 * every decision it makes about the *shape* of a database write lives here
 * instead, where it can be exercised directly.
 *
 * There is a specific reason this module exists rather than the engine simply
 * calling the normalizers inline. Three columns the engine writes are Postgres
 * enums, and `scanEngine.ts` was reaching all three of them with values that are
 * not members:
 *
 *  - `ScanResult.policyDecision` and `ScanJob.policyDecision` are
 *    `PolicyDecision` (`PASS | REVIEW | BLOCK`), and `iq.evaluateFindings`
 *    answers `'PASS' | 'REVIEW REQUIRED' | 'BLOCKED'`. Two of the three
 *    answers are rejected.
 *  - `Finding.type` is `FindingType` (`SECRET | VULNERABILITY | MISCONFIG`) and
 *    `scanner.ts` stores display labels — `'Secret'`, `'Vulnerability'`,
 *    `'Misconfig'` — via `normalizeFindingTypeLabel`. All three are rejected.
 *
 * `src/lib/queue/worker.ts` has been converting these since #633 with
 * `normalizePolicyDecisionEnum` and `normalizeFindingTypeEnum`; the async engine
 * added in #712 passed `as any` instead. `as any` silences the compiler and
 * changes nothing about what Postgres does with the value, and because the
 * engine's persistence phase is wrapped in a `catch` that only logs, the
 * rejection was invisible: the job reported `COMPLETED` and no row appeared.
 *
 * So the conversions are centralised, named, and covered.
